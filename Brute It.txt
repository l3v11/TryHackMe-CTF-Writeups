--- Brute It ---

1. Check nmap > Ports 22, and 80 are open.
2. Seeing the port 80 open, we can say it must be a website. Though visiting the website gives nothing.
3. Use gobuster with /usr/share/dirb/wordlists/common.txt wordlist to find any hidden directory. We get the /admin directory.
   The /admin directory gives us a login portal and asks for username and password. The source code of the login panel says the username
   is "admin".
4. Let's crack the password using the command
   > hydra -l admin -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt $IP http-post-form "/admin/:user=^USER^&pass=^PASS^:invalid"
   The password is "xavier". Logging into the Admin Panel with the credential, we got the web flag and a SSH private key and a name
   "john" which might be an username.
5. Let's download the id_rsa file into our local machine. Now, change the permission of the file by "chmod 400 id_rsa". Next login to ssh
   using the id_rsa file and the username "john" we got before but asks for passphrase. Cracking it using ssh2john and john gives us the
   passphrase which is "rockinroll". Next login into ssh using the passphrase and we're in. This gives us the user.txt flag.
6. Using "sudo -l" command says that we can run "/bin/cat" command as sudo without password. GTFO has an entry for cat. Using that
   we can read the "/etc/passwd" and "/etc/shadow" files. Let's save the entry for root from both files into our local machine. Next
   unshadow these files using "unshadow passwd shadow > hash" command. Cracking the "hash" file gives us the root's password.
7. Logging in as root using the password gives root.txt flag.
