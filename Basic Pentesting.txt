--- Basic Pentesting ---

1. Check nmap > Ports 22, 80, 139, 445, 8009, and 8080 are open.
2. Seeing ports 80 and 8080 open, we can say it must be a website.
3. Visiting the website gives nothing. Checking the source code of the index page
   says to check the dev note. But after inspecting we still get nothing.
4. Use gobuster with /usr/share/dirbuster/wordlists/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt wordlist to find any hidden directory.
   Well we got /development directory. Visiting this directory gives us two files - dev.txt and j.txt.
5. Our next question asks for brute-forcing user and pass. So let's enumerate the machine with
   enum4linux $IP command. We get two users - kay and jan.
6. Let's brute-force the password for user jan. Let's use hydra to do this on SSH.
   hydra -l jan -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt ssh://IP
   We get the password which is "armando".
7. SSH the user jan with the password.
8. sudo -l says we cannot use this command.
9. There's another user kay in the home directory. Doing ls gives us pass.bak file, again access denied.
10. Let's use linpeas. Save it in the /tmp directory. Chmod and run the script.
11. We can see that id.rsa file is accessible on the user kay. Let's copy this on our local machine.
12. Using ssh2john and john gives the password "beeswax".
13. Login into SSH using the file id_rsa and the above password.
14. Now we can see the content of the file pass.bak, which is our targeted password.
