--- Fowsniff CTF ---

1. Check nmap with "-p- -T4" flags > Ports 22, 80, 110 (pop3), and 143 (imap) are open.
2. Seeing the port 80 open, we can say it must be a website. Visiting the website, we can see that it is the official website of
   Fowsniff Corp. But the website says that it is temporarily out of service as their internal system suffered a data breach that
   resulted in the exposure of employee usernames and passwords. The attackers also hacked their official @fowsniffcorp Twitter (Now X)
   account. Well time to visit Fnowsniff's Twitter account to see if we can get any sensitive info. And surprisingly, we got the
   password dump. The password dump contains some user:pass credentials and mentions that these are email passwords. It also mentions
   that their pop3 server is wide open and the passwords are hashed using MD5 algorithm. Well enough info for us. Let's get to work.
3. Extract the password hashes from the password dump file using this sed command
   > sed -n 's/.*://p' fowsniff.txt > hashes.txt
   Let's crack these MD5 hashes but 1 hash is left uncracked which is the password hash for the user "stone". Now save these cracked
   passwords in a text file.
4. Now extract the usernames from the password dump file using this awk command
   > awk -F'@' '{print $1}' fowsniff.txt > users.txt
   Clear all the unnecessary clutters from this user.txt file.
5. Let's use Metasploit to search for any exploit related to pop3 as we saw from step 2 that the company's pop3 server is wide open. We
   get an interesting exploit titled "pop3_login". As we have a user:pass list, this exploit might be useful. Running the exploit we get
   a valid credential which is "seina:scoobydoo2".
6. Now connect to pop3 using the command "nc $IP 110". To login, let's use the following command
   > user seina
   > pass scoobydoo2
   To view the mails list, we will use the command "list", and to view any email we will use the command "retr 1", "retr 2", ... The
   1st email gives us the SSH password which is "S1ck3nBluff+secureshell" and the sender of the 2nd email is the SSH username which is
   "baksteen". Now login to the server using SSH and we're in.
7. The next question gives us a hint to check what group does the user "baksteen" belong to and if there is any interesting file that
   can be run by that group. Let's use the find command to do so
   > find / -group users 2>/dev/null
   We got an interesting file "/opt/cube/cube.sh". This file has read, write and executable permission for the usergroup "users", our
   current user also belongs to this group. This file is run as root when a user connects to the machine using SSH. We know this as we
   are presented with the same Fowsniff Corp. banner when we login to SSH. Let's look in /etc/update-motd.d/00-header file and we see
   that there is an entry for "/opt/cube/cube.sh" at the end.
8. Let's add a reverse shell into this bash script and start our listener. When we re-login we get the root shell.
