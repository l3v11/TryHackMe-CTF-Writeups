1. Check nmap > Ports 21, 22, 139, 445, 3128 (Squid http proxy 3.5.12), and 3333 (Apache) are open.
2. Use gobuster with /usr/share/dirb/wordlists/common.txt wordlist to find any hidden directory. We get the /internal directory. Visiting
   the /hidden directory, we get an upload form. Let's try to upload our PHP reverse shell, but says that extension not allowed. But
   after trying with several php extensions, we found that .phtml extension is accepted. Now, let's use gobuster again with
   /usr/share/dirb/wordlists/common.txt wordlist to find any hidden directory. We get the /uploads directory. Visiting the
   /uploads directory, we get our reverse shell listed there. Netcat gives us a shell.
3. We can see that there is a user named "bill" from /etc/passwd. We get user.txt flag from the /home/bill directory.
4. Linpeas gives us an interesting SUID file - /bin/systemctl. Let's use GTFO to exploit this binary. But we need to use this modified
   payload instead of the GTFO one.

   TF=$(mktemp).service
   echo '[Service]
   Type=oneshot
   ExecStart=/bin/sh -c "cat /root/root.txt > /tmp/out"
   [Install]
   WantedBy=multi-user.target' > $TF
   systemctl link $TF
   systemctl enable --now $TF

   We get root.txt flag from /tmp/out file.
