1. Check nmap > Ports 22, and 80 are open.
2. Seeing the port 80 open, we can say it must be a website. Though visiting the website gives nothing.
3. Use gobuster with /usr/share/dirbuster/wordlists/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt wordlist to find any hidden directory.
   We get the /admin and /etc directory. The /admin directory gives us a music related website.
   The /etc directory gives us a passwd file which contains a password hash. Cracking it using john gives us the password "squidward". 
4. There is a "Admins" category, which reveals an "Admin Shoutbox", where we can learn about a music archive file. If we roam around, we
   can get an "archive.tar" file from "Archive" category.
5. Let's extract the "archive.tar" file. There's a folder named "final_archive" inside the extracted directory. The "README" file says
   this is a Borg Backup repository.
6. Change directory into previous directory. Then list the files using "borg list final_archive" command. It asks for a passphrase. Let's
   use the password we got earlier. We can see that there's another directory named "music_archive". Using the command
   "borg list final_archive::music_archive" lists all the files.
7. Let's extract all the files using "borg extract final_archive::music_archive" command.
8. We got an interesting file "note.txt" inside home/field/dev/home/alex/Documents/ directory. It reveals a user:pass credential.
9. As port 22 is open this credential might be for SSH. Let's SSH into the server using the credential and we got the user.txt flag.
10. Using "sudo -l" command says that we can run "/etc/mp3backups/backup.sh" as sudo. Let's attempt to add write permission to the file
    using "chmod +w /etc/mp3backups/backup.sh" and we got success.
11. Let's use this command "echo '/bin/bash' > /etc/mp3backups/backup.sh" and run the script as sudo and this gives us root.txt flag.
