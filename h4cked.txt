1. Check nmap > Ports 21, 22, 80, and 111 (rpcbind) are open.
2. Seeing the port 80 open, we can say it must be a website. Though visiting the website gives nothing.
3. Use gobuster with /usr/share/dirbuster/wordlists/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt wordlist to find any hidden directory. We get the
   /island directory. The source code of the /island directory gives us a code word which is "vigilante". Let's use gobuster with
   /usr/share/dirbuster/wordlists/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt wordlist in the /island directory to find any hidden directory. We get
   the /2100 directory. The source code of the /2100 directory says that we can avail our .ticket here. Seems like .ticket is a file
   extension. Let's use gobuster with /usr/share/dirbuster/wordlists/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt wordlist and .ticket extension to
   find any hidden file. We get the /green_arrow.ticket file. Visiting the /green_arrow.ticket file gives us the password "RTy8yhBQdscX"
   which seems ciphered. Analyzing it with dCode.fr Cipher Identifier we see that it is encoded using Base58 algorithm. Decrypting it
   we get the original password "!#th3h00d".
4. As port 21 (ftp) is open, let's try to login to ftp using the credential vigilante:!#th3h00d which we got earlier and we're in.
   We get three files "Leave_me_alone.png", "Queen's_Gambit.png", and "aa.jpg". Let's get these files on our local machine. Using "cd .."
   command we can see that there is another user "slade" but we can't cd into it.
5. Let's proceed with steganography as we got images only. The file "Leave_me_alone.png" is corrupted. The file command also says that it's
   a data file which is suspicious as it is a PNG file. Let's edit the file using hexeditor and we can see that the file signature doesn't
   match with PNG. Fixing this issue we can open the file and this gives us the text "password".
6. Another file "Queen's_Gambit.png" is PNG iamge but analyzing it we got nothing.
7. The file "aa.jpg" is a JPEG image. Using steghide with the passphrase "password" we got from step 5 extracts two files > "passwd.txt"
   and "shado". The file "passwd.txt" doesn't give us anything but the file "shado" gives us a text "M3tahuman" which seems like a password.
8. Let's try to login to ssh using the name "slade" we got from step 4 and the password "M3tahuman" we got from step 7 and we're in. This
   gives us the user.txt flag.
9. Now, let's escalate our shell as root. Using "sudo -l" command says that we can run "/usr/bin/pkexec" command as sudo without password.
   GTFO has an entry for pkexec. Using that we got a root shell and got the root.txt flag.
