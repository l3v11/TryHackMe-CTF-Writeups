1. Check nmap > Port 80 is open, so it could be a website. Open in browser.
2. Check robots.txt > Looks like a password or something, note it.
3. Check the source code of index page. We get username from here.
4. Use gobuster with /usr/share/dirbuster/wordlists/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt wordlist.
   We get login.php page.
5. Visit the login page and login with the credential we found earlier.
6. We get Command Injection vulnerability here.
7. Do ls, we get the first flag file. But we can't cat it. So use less command.
8. Do ls into /home/rick. There we get the 2nd flag.
9. Let's do ls into /root. Nothing shows. Let's check our permission with sudo -l.
   From here we can see that we can run any command as root.
10. So, use sudo ls /root and we can see there's the third flag.
