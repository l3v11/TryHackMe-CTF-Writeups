--- Overpass ---

1. Check nmap > Ports 22, and 80 are open.
2. Seeing the port 80 open, we can say it must be a website. Though visiting the website gives nothing.
3. Use gobuster with /usr/share/dirbuster/wordlists/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt wordlist to find any hidden directory.
   We get the /admin directory. Visiting /admin gives us a login page.
4. After checking the source code of the page, we can see that there is a "login.js" file. And the script is 
   checking cookie tokens and granting access, as no cookies are generated. So, we can give our cookie matching
   the conditions. Let's set our cookie to "SessionToken=any_value". After refreshing the page we are in the admin panel.
5. We get a username "james" and a ssh private key and also a hint which says about cracking it.
6. Using ssh2john and john gives us the passphrase for the private key. Logging into the ssh with these credentials
   gives us the user.txt flag and todo.txt file which says about an automated build script.
7. Let's check the /etc/crontab file which says that a buildscript.sh file is being downloaded from 
   overpass.thm/downloads/src/buildscript.sh.
8. Check the /etc/hosts file. There's an entry for overpass.thm. Also the user james can edit the /etc/hosts file
   in this machine. So, create an entry for overpass.thm with our local machine's IP in the /etc/hosts file of both
   the targeted machine and our local machine .
9. Now create a buildscript.sh file with a reverse shell in our local machine in the same location addressed in the crontab.
10. Let's start a python http server at port 80 and listen the port mentioned in the shell with nc (netcat).
11. After a while we get the root shell and the root.txt flag.
