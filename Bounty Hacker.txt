1. Check nmap > Ports 21, 22, and 80 are open.
2. Seeing the port 80 open, we can say it must be a website. Visiting the website gives some chat history.
3. Port 21 is open, which is ftp and we can see that Anonymous login is allowed. Let's login into the ftp with
   user anonymous. We get two files - locks.txt and task.txt.
4. The file task.txt gives us the username "lin" and the file locks.txt seems like a wordlist.
5. Let's use hydra to brute-force the SSH using the locks.txt wordlist and we get our SSH creds.
6. Logging into SSH gives us user.txt flag.
7. Doing "sudo -l" says that the current user may run "tar" command as root. GTFO has an entry for tar.
   Using that gives us root shell and root.txt flag.
