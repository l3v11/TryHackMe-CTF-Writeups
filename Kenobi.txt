1. Check nmap > Ports 21 (ProFtpd), 22, 80, 111 (rpc), 139, 445, and 2049 (nfs) are open.
2. Let's enumerate the SMB using nmap. We get the share /anonymous and we can see that anonymous login is enabled. After login, we get
   the log.txt file. From that file, we get a ftp username "kenobi" and anonymous login is enabled. Also ssh key is generated for that
   user "kenobi".
3. Now, enumerate the nfs on port 111 using nmap. We get the mount directory /var.
4. As our ProFtpd is version 1.3.5, we have found an exploit from ProFtpd's mod_copy module from searchsploit. The mod_copy module
   implements SITE CPFR and SITE CPTO commands, which can be used to copy files/directories from one place to another on the server.
   Any unauthenticated client can leverage these commands to copy files from any part of the filesystem to a chosen destination. Let's
   copy Kenobi's private key using SITE CPFR and SITE CPTO commands. But, first we need to login to the ftp using "nc IP 21" command.
   We know that the /var directory is a mount from step 3. So, let's move Kenobi's private key to the /var/tmp directory using the
   following commands.
   > SITE CPFR /home/kenobi/.ssh/id_rsa
   > SITE CPTO /var/tmp/id_rsa
5. Let's mount the /var directory to our machine using the following command.
   > sudo mkdir /mnt/kenobi
   > sudo mount -t nfs $IP:/var /mnt/kenobi -o nolock
6. After successful mounting, let's copy the id_rsa file to our machine. Logging into the ssh gives us the user.txt flag.
7. Time to escalate our privilege as root. We can see there is an interesting SUID binary "/usr/bin/menu" running as root. The strings
   command shows that the binary runs "curl, uname and ifconfig" commands upon execution. Let's manipulate our path gain a root shell
   using the following commands.
   > echo "/bin/bash" > /tmp/ifconfig
   > chmod 777 /tmp/ifconfig
   > export PATH=/tmp:$PATH
   > /usr/bin/menu (Choose option 3)
8. After successful exploitation, we're root and got the root.txt flag.
