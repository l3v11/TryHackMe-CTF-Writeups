--- Startup ---

1. Check nmap > Ports 21, 22, and 80 are open.
2. Seeing the port 80 open, we can say it must be a website. Though visiting the website gives nothing.
3. Use gobuster with /usr/share/dirbuster/wordlists/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt wordlist to find any hidden directory.
   We get the /files directory, and this gives us notice.txt and important.jpg files. The file notice.txt mentions about a suspicious
   activity which states that the file important.jpg was not uploaded by the site admin. We also got another directory /ftp inside 
   the directory that means we can upload files into this directory using ftp.
4. We can also see that port 21 is open and it supports anonymous login. Logging into the ftp we get /ftp directory. Let's upload our
   shell.php file inside this directory using "put shell.php" command.
5. Listen to our nc (netcat) port and we got a shell which gives us recipe.txt flag. There is also another interesting file named
   "suspicious.pcapng" in the /incidents directory.
6. We will share this file on port 1234 on the remote server using "cat suspicious.pcapng | nc -lp 1234" command and get this file
   on our local machine using "nc 10.10.44.180 1234 > suspicious.pcapng" command.
7. It's a network capture file, so let's open this file using wireshark.
8. Let's type "data" into the filtering section. By right-clicking on the TCP protocol, select Follow -> TCP Stream to view the content
   and we got a password "c4ntg3t3n0ughsp1c3" downwards.
9. Also if we remember, we had already got an username in the /home directory which is "lennie". Logging into the ssh gives us the
   user.txt flag and an interesting file "planner.sh" which executes "/etc/print.sh" file.
10. Let's read the "/etc/print.sh" file, it is an executable file. Now, let's add our reverse shell in it using ">>" operator.
11. Now run the "/scripts/planner.sh" file and listen to our nc (netcat) port and we got a root shell. This gives us root.txt flag.
