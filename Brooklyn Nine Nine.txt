1. Check nmap > Ports 21, 22, and 80 are open.
2. Seeing the port 80 open, we can say it must be a website. Though visiting the website gives us an image. Viewing the source of this page
   we can find a hint which states that the image might be related to steganography. Let's download the image.
3. Steghide couldn't extract any data and says compressed data is corrupted. But stegseek works fine and we got a txt file extracted.
   It gives us Holt's password.
4. As port 22 is open this credential might be for SSH. Let's SSH into the server using the credential and we got the user.txt flag.
5. Now let's escalate our shell as root. Doing "sudo -l" says that the current user may run "nano" command as root. GTFO has an entry for
   nano. Using that gives us root shell and root.txt flag.
