1. Check nmap > Ports 22, and 80 are open.
2. Seeing the port 80 open, we can say it must be a website. Though visiting the website gives nothing.
3. Use gobuster with /usr/share/dirbuster/wordlists/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt wordlist to find any hidden directory.
   We get the /content directory. Visiting /content gives us SweetRice CMS. Finding for SweetRice CMS on GTFO, we can
   see an interesting entry "SweetRice 1.5.1 - Backup Disclosure". It says that we can access to all mysql backup and
   download them from this directory > http://localhost/inc/mysql_backup.
4. Again use gobuster with /usr/share/dirbuster/wordlists/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt wordlist in the /content directory
   to find any hidden directory. We get the /as directory. Visiting /as gives us a login page.
5. Now, editing the "mysql_bakup_20191129023059-1.5.1.sql" file, we get these info
	admin: manager
	passwd: 42f749ade7f9e195bf475f37a44cafcb (MD5) - Password123
6. Let's login to the admin panel with this credentials.
7. We can upload files in the Media Center. Let's upload our reverse shell here. But it doesn't accept .php files. Let's bypass
   this with .php5 extension and we got a shell. The home directory gives us user.txt flag. We can also find an interesting file
   which is backup.pl, but only root can edit it but we can read it. This file says that it executes /etc/copy.sh file.
8. The /etc/copy.sh file says that it executes a reverse shell and has read-write permission for guest user which is us. Let's
   add our reverse shell in this file and execute backup.pl file with "sudo /usr/bin/perl /home/itguy/backup.pl" command and we
   got a root shell along with our root.txt flag.
