1. Check nmap > Ports 21, 22, and 80 are open.
2. Seeing the port 80 open, we can say it must be a website. Though visiting the website gives nothing.
3. Use gobuster with /usr/share/dirb/wordlists/common.txt wordlist to find any hidden directory. We get the /assets directory.
   The /assets directory gives us two files > RickRolled.mp4 and style.css. Opening style.css file, it says to take a look at the 
   /sup3r_s3cr3t_fl4g.php page. But it redirects us to the RickRoll video.
4. Let's open burpsuite and intercept the request. Forwarding it once gives us a hidden directory which is "/WExYY2Cv-qU". Visiting this
   directory we get the "Hot_Babe.png" file. Download this file into our local machine.
5. The strings command reveals the username for FTP which is "ftpuser" and a password list. Save the passwords in a file.
   Let's crack the FTP password using the command
   > hydra -l ftpuser -P pass $IP ftp
   The password is "5iez1wGXKfPKQ". Logging into the FTP with the credential, we got the "Eli's_Creds.txt" file. The texts inside the file
   is encrypted using BrainFuck Cipher. Converting it to plaintext using dCode.fr website gives the credential
   	User: eli
	Password: DSpDiM1wAEwid
6. As port 22 is open this credential might be for SSH. Let's SSH into the server using the credential and we're in. Upon login we are
   presented with this message
   > Message from Root to Gwendoline:
   > "Gwendoline, I am not happy with you. Check our leet s3cr3t hiding place. I've left you a hidden message there"
7. The message tells us about a hiding place called "s3cr3t". Let's search using this text if it exists or not using the command
   > find / -name s3cr3t 2>/dev/null
   We get /usr/games/s3cr3t which is a directory. Inside it a file ".th1s_m3ss4ag3_15_f0r_gw3nd0l1n3_0nly!" exists. This file gives us
   ssh credential for the user gwendoline which is "gwendoline:MniVCQVhQHUNI".
8. Logging as user Gwendoline with the above credential, we get the user.txt flag.
9. Now, let's escalate our shell as root. Doing "sudo -l" gives "(ALL, !root) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/vi /home/gwendoline/user.txt".
   ExploitDB has an interesting entry for sudo which is "sudo 1.8.27 - Security Bypass" and GTFO has an entry for vi. Using these let's
   run this command > "sudo -u#-1 /usr/bin/vi /home/gwendoline/user.txt". Then press ":" and spawn a shell by typing "!/bin/bash". And we
   we got the root shell and this gives us root.txt flag.
