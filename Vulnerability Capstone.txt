--- Vulnerability Capstone ---

1. Check nmap > Port 80 is open and says the website is run by FUEL CMS. Visiting the website we can see that we can login to the admin
   panel by visiting the /fuel directory and the user:pass credential is admin:admin and it works. But we can't get anything from here.
2. Let's search for "fuel cms" using searchsploit command and "Fuel CMS 1.4.1 - Remote Code Execution (3)" entry seems interesting.
   Running this script with the website url gives us a RCE shell.
3. Now run a nc mkfifo (netcat) reverse shell on the server and listen to the port on our local machine and we got flag.txt flag.
