--- RootMe ---

1. Check nmap > Ports 22, and 80 are open.
2. Seeing the port 80 open, we can say it must be a website. Though visiting the website gives nothing.
3. Use gobuster with /usr/share/dirbuster/wordlists/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt wordlist to find the hidden directory.
   We get the /panel and /uploads directory. Visiting /panel gives us the ability to upload a shell.
4. But the server rejects uploading shell with .php extension.
5. Let's bypass this with the tricks mentioned here > https://book.hacktricks.xyz/pentesting-web/file-upload.
6. After using .phtml extension, the server accepts the file. The file is uploaded into the /uploads directory.
7. Using nc (netcat) gives us a shell.
8. But /home directory doesn't give us user.txt flag.
9. So let's search the file in the system using this command > "find / -name user.ext 2> /dev/null" and we get the user flag.
10. Now let's find SUID binary on the system using linpeas. We can see that python has the SUID bit set.
11. GTFO has an entry for python. Using that gives us root shell.
12. Now following the step 9 for the root.txt file gives us the root flag.
