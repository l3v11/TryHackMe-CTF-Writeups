1. Check nmap > Ports 22, 80, 1234 (Apache Tomcat), and 8009 are open.
2. Seeing the port 80 open, we can say it must be a website. Though visiting the website gives nothing.
3. Use gobuster with /usr/share/dirb/wordlists/common.txt wordlist to find any hidden directory. We get the /guidelines and /protected
   directories. Visiting the /guidelines directory we get a username "bob" and it mentions about a TomCat server. We know from nmap
   scan that a Tomcat server is running on port 1234. The /protected directory has a basic authentication system and requires a username
   and a password.
4. Let's use hydra to crack the password of the /protected directory using the username "bob" and the following command
   > hydra -l bob -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt $IP http-get "/protected"
   The password is "bubbles". Logging into the /protected directory with the credential, we learn that the directory has been moved to
   a new port. As we got a mention about TomCat server before let's visit port 1234 and we get the version details of the Tomcat server
   which is "Apache Tomcat/7.0.88".
5. The next question tells us to use Nikto with the credentials we have found and scan the /manager/html directory on the port 1234.
   Let's use the following command
   > nikto -h http://$IP:1234/manager/html -id bob:bubbles
   This scan took way long time. But Nikto identified 5 documentation files. We can also find that the version 1.1 of Apache-Coyote
   server is running. From previous nmap scan we got the server version which is "Apache/2.4.18".
6. Now, we need to run metasploit. Let's use the command msfconsole to run it. Next run the command "search tomcat" to find any good
   exploit. We'll look for excellent rank and only for manager exploits. The exploit "tomcat_mgr_upload" seems like the one we're looking
   for. Let's use it but for some reason it's not working on our VMware Kali. So, let's switch to the THM AttackBox and we got a
   meterpreter shell. Switching to shell we got the username "root" and the root.txt flag.
