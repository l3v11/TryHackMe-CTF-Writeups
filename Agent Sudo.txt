--- Agent Sudo ---

1. Check nmap > Ports 21, 22, and 80 are open.
2. Seeing the port 80 open, we can say it must be a website. The website says to use the dev's codename
   as user-agent to access the site.
3. The hint tells us to use user-agent as "C". Doing so gives us the agent name "chris". And also tells us that agent J's password is weak.
4. We can assume that our ftp password is "chris". Now let's use hydra to crack our ftp password. This gives us the ftp password "crystal".
5. Logging into the ftp gives us three files - one txt file and two images.
6. The file "To_agentJ.txt" says that the images are fake. So this gives us hint that it might be steganography related.
7. Using binwalk tool on cutie.png gives us a zip file "8702.zip" which is password protected.
8. Now john comes into play. zip2john and john crack the password which is "alien". Though we can't extract data from the zip file.
9. Let's use stegseek on the "cute-alien.jpg" file. This gives us the password "Area51". Also we get the "cute-alien.jpg.out" file
   from this process which gives us the other agent's name which is "james" and the ssh password "hackerrules!".
10. Logging into the ssh gives us the user_flag.txt flag and an image.
11. Let's transfer the image into our local machine using scp.
12. The hint says us to use the reverse image search. Doing so tells that the incident of the photo is called "Roswell Alien Autopsy".
13. Now let's escalate our shell as root. Command "sudo -l" gives us "(ALL, !root) /bin/bash" that means we may manipulate sudo.
14. Searching for "sudo" on ExploitDB we can see that there is an interesting entry which is "sudo 1.8.27 - Security Bypass" and
    it's CVE is 2019-14287. From here we get our command which is "sudo -u#-1 /bin/bash". This gives us a root shell and the root flag.
    Also we get the real name of Agent R which is "DesKel".
